# Classification-and-Captioning-of-Aircraft-Damage-Using-Pretrained-Models
### Final Project of IBM course: Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras
Aircraft damage detection is essential for maintaining the safety and longevity of aircraft. Traditional manual inspection methods are time-consuming and prone to human error. This project aims to automate the classification of aircraft damage into two categories: "dent" and "crack." For this, we will utilize feature extraction with a pre-trained VGG16 model to classify the damage from aircraft images. Additionally, we will use a pre-trained Transformer model from Hugging Face to generate captions and summaries for the images.
